# BlackJack

Made by tplayer
in collaboration with 
gcrois, PokemonPower92

A BlackJack Python game
A sub repo of MicroBat

To start using activate a python virtual env.
Then use the command

Python3 BlackJack.py

Follow the prompts, have fun!

The framework for the task is as follows,

1: create a blackjack game where the user is prompted to hit
or stay. If the player busts remove money from that player's 
account until the player is broke and can't bet. 

2: Use Tensorflow to hack Crand by playing the game a ton of times
and get good at counting the cards and see if hitting/ staying is a good move.

3: link this program/application to the main groups website game host
on flask.

That is the general framework of what to do now, I'll try to get a basic 
BlackJack working and try some test cases
